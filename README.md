#### Setup Menu

##### Backup

Though an initial backup is performed upon first starting the installer, you may also use the _Backup_ option to export the current preset as a `.mcpack` file. These settings can later be restored by installing the backup file as a custom preset.

##### Uninstall

Selecting the _Uninstall_ option will revert the BetterRTX Installer's changes and remove its cached files.
